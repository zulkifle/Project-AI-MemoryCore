# Mulahazah -- Behavioral Learning System
*The AI that remembers how you work.*

## Activation

When this skill activates, output:

`Mulahazah active -- reading learned rules for this project...`

Then execute the protocol below.

## Overview

Mulahazah is a passive observation layer built into your AI companion. It captures every tool call as structured data, analyzes patterns with Haiku, and writes actionable rules to `rules.md`. Those rules persist across sessions -- silently shaping how your AI works with you, without needing to be reminded each time.

## Context Guard

| Context | Status |
|---------|--------|
| **User asks about learned rules or patterns** | ACTIVE -- full protocol |
| **User types `/continuous-improvement`** | ACTIVE -- full protocol |
| **User says "what have you learned"** | ACTIVE -- full protocol |
| **User wants to see rule summary** | ACTIVE -- full protocol |
| **General coding conversation** | DORMANT -- follow rules.md silently |
| **User is explicitly asking about Forge skills** | DORMANT -- use Forge skill instead |

## Protocol

### Step 1: Read Learned Rules

- [ ] Check `~/.claude/mulahazah/rules.md` -- this is where learned rules live
- [ ] If the file does not exist, report "No rules yet. Run `/continuous-improvement` after a work session to generate them."
- [ ] Count and display total rules

### Step 2: Session Reflection

Generate a reflection for this session:

```
## Reflection -- [Date]
- What worked:
- What failed:
- What I'd do differently:
- Rule to add:
```

If there is a "Rule to add", check `~/.claude/mulahazah/rules.md` to see if it already exists. If not, append it.

### Step 3: Analyze Observations (if requested or on /continuous-improvement)

- [ ] Check for `~/.claude/mulahazah/projects/*/observations.jsonl`
- [ ] If 5+ observations exist, run: `bash ~/.claude/mulahazah/bin/analyze.sh`
- [ ] Report what analysis found: new rules extracted, or "no new patterns yet"
- [ ] If no observations found, note that hooks may not be installed

### Step 4: Report Observer Status

- [ ] Check if `~/.claude/mulahazah/observer.pid` exists and process is alive
- [ ] If running: show PID and confirm background analysis is active
- [ ] If not running: mention it is optional, show start command: `bash ~/.claude/mulahazah/agents/start-observer.sh`

### Step 5: Display Full Rule Status

Read `~/.claude/mulahazah/rules.md` and display:
- Total rule count
- Rules grouped by date they were added
- Any rules that look outdated or contradictory (flag for user review)

## Mandatory Rules

1. Never hallucinate rules. Only report rules that exist in `~/.claude/mulahazah/rules.md`.
2. Never invent observations -- only report what exists in observations.jsonl files.
3. If `~/.claude/mulahazah/` does not exist, output the installation prompt and stop.
4. Do not auto-apply rules without the user's awareness -- surface them in the reflection step.
5. When rules.md exists and contains rules, follow them in your work during this session.

## Edge Cases

| Situation | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| **No rules.md yet** | Report "No rules yet for this project. Run `/continuous-improvement` after your first work session." |
| **Mulahazah not installed** | Output: "Mulahazah is not installed. See Feature/Mulahazah-System/install-mulahazah.md to get started." |
| **Observer not running** | Note it is optional and show start command. Do not block skill execution. |
| **analyze.sh not found** | Report the missing path and remind user to re-run install steps. |
| **Fewer than 5 observations** | Note more tool calls are needed before patterns can be extracted. |

## Synergy with Other Features

| Feature | How Mulahazah Interacts |
|---------|-------------------------|
| **Forge** | Rule clusters from rules.md with repeated patterns become Forge skill proposals. |
| **Save Diary** | Active rules from rules.md are summarized in the session diary. |
| **Memory Consolidation** | Triggers review of rules.md for stale or contradictory entries. |
| **Decision Log** | Rules applied during a session are logged as behavioral decisions. |

## Level History

- **Lv.1** -- Base: rules.md persistence, session reflection, observation capture via `observe.sh`, Haiku-powered analysis via `analyze.sh`, `/continuous-improvement` command. Background observer optional. (Origin: continuous-improvement v2.0, ported to MemoryCore as Mulahazah System. Tested end-to-end: observations captured, analyze.sh extracted "Grep → Read → Edit workflow" rule.)
