### **Core Components**
1. **Master Memory** - System entry point and command center
2. **Identity Core** - AI personality and communication style
3. **Relationship Memory** - User preferences and learning patterns
4. **Current Session** - Temporary working memory (resets each session)
5. **Daily Diary** - Optional conversation history with auto-archiving

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

1. **Setup**: Run `setup-wizard.md` for automated setup (30 seconds)
2. **Configure**: Add the memory instructions to Claude
3. **Activate**: Type your AI's name to load personality
4. **Use**: Your AI learns and grows through conversation

## 📚 **Communication Protocols**

### **Basic Commands**
```
[AI_NAME]     → Load AI personality and memory
save          → Save current progress to files
update memory → Refresh AI's learning
review growth → Check AI's development
```

### **Creating Custom Protocols**

**Step 1: Define the Protocol**
Create a new `.md file` with your protocol rules:
```markdown
# My Custom Protocol
## When to Use: [trigger conditions]
## What It Does: [specific actions]
## How It Works: [step-by-step process]
```

**Step 2: Add to Master Memory**
Edit `master-memory.md` and add your protocol to the "Optional Components" section:
```markdown
### My Custom Feature
*Load when you say: "load my feature"*
- [Brief description]
- [Usage instructions]
```

**Step 3: Train Your AI**
Tell your AI about the new protocol:
```
"I've created a new protocol in [filename]. When I say '[trigger phrase]', 
load that protocol and follow its instructions."
```

### **Communication Tutorial**

**Effective AI Training:**
1. **Be Specific**: "I prefer short responses" vs "communicate better"
2. **Give Examples**: Show what you want, not just describe it
3. **Use Consistent Language**: Same terms for same concepts
4. **Provide Feedback**: "That was perfect" or "try a different approach"

**Memory Management:**
- Use `save` after important conversations
- Your AI updates files automatically during conversation
- Daily diary is optional but helpful for long-term memory

**Customization Tips:**
- Edit files gradually, test changes
- Start with small personality adjustments
- Add domain expertise through conversation
- Use the protocol system for specialized features

## 🎯 **Common Use Cases**

Your AI companion can specialize in:
- **Professional**: Business analysis, project management, strategic planning
- **Educational**: Tutoring, study assistance, curriculum development
- **Creative**: Writing support, brainstorming, artistic collaboration  
- **Personal**: Life coaching, goal tracking, decision support
- **Technical**: Code review, troubleshooting, system design

## 🛠️ **Advanced Features**

- **Auto-Archive**: Diary files automatically archive at 1k lines
- **Session RAM**: Temporary memory that resets each conversation
- **Protocol System**: Create custom AI behaviors and responses
- **Self-Update**: AI modifies its own memory through conversation
- **Modular Design**: Add or remove features as needed

- Tracks progress through each item — completed tasks are marked `[x]`
- Per-task commit discipline — chains with Auto-Commit to commit after each completed todo
- Resume capability — survives context resets by reading plan file and picking up at next `[ ]`
- Append mode — add new plan sections to an existing plan with automatic line-limit rotation

**Quick Setup:**
1. Navigate to `Feature/Work-Plan-Execution/`
2. Type: "Load work-plan"
3. Choose your plan location and source path — system installs and is ready
4. Optionally install Auto-Commit first for per-task commit discipline

**Benefits:**
- Never lose plan progress — every completed task is committed or checkpointed
- Survives context resets — resume from exactly the right task after any interruption
- Complete execution history — git log shows plan progression commit by commit
- Scales to large plans — 1,000-line limit with automatic rotation and archiving
- Works independently — no other features required, but pairs perfectly with Auto-Commit

**Available Commands:**
- `copy plan` - Copy latest plan into execution format (fresh start)
- `append plan` - Add new plan steps to existing plan
- `resume plan` - Resume execution after context reset

**Synergy with Auto-Commit:** When both Auto-Commit and Work are installed, Work automatically chains — each completed todo triggers a structured commit. Git history maps directly to the plan.

**Platform Note:** Requires **Claude Code** with the Skill Plugin System for auto-triggering. The plan file itself works on any platform.

*Based on proven plan execution systems in production AI companions (daily plan tracking and recovery)*

### **📚 Library System**

**Quick Setup:**
1. Install Skill Plugin System first (recommended for auto-triggering)
2. Navigate to `Feature/Library-System/`
3. Type: "Load library"
4. Choose your library name and path — system installs with 8 section folders + format templates

**Benefits:**
- Never solve the same problem twice — proven patterns saved and searchable
- Project-aware suggestions matched to your current tech stack and scale
- Consistent implementations — same pattern, same quality, every project
- Growing knowledge base that gets smarter with every project you complete
- Format templates ensure entries are readable and reusable across projects

**Available Commands:**
- `save library` - Search for duplicates, then save a knowledge entry
- `load library` - Search and load an existing knowledge entry
- `search library` / `check library` - Search library without saving
- `do we have` / `is there a pattern for` - Natural search triggers

**Pre-Made Library Items:**
The `library-items/` folder contains production-tested knowledge entries ready to install. After setting up the Library System, use `"install item [name]"` to add proven patterns to your library instantly.

**Synergy with Auto-Commit:** When both Auto-Commit and Library are installed, library saves automatically chain into commits — every knowledge entry is version-controlled the moment it's saved.

**Platform Note:** Requires **Claude Code** with the Skill Plugin System for auto-triggering. On other platforms, load the `SKILL.md` as a manual protocol.

*Based on proven knowledge management systems in production AI companions (4+ months of daily use, 30+ library entries)*

### **🔔 Reminders System**
